Reference is to your May 4, 2018 memorandum, titled "Research Nonprofit's Ability to Sell Pet Merchandise Using NFL/MLB Logos," seeking information regarding the legal issues pertaining to\ purchase and resale of copyrighted material.

\begin{itemize}

 \item It is not legal for an individual or business entity to manufacture or otherwise make and subsequently sell goods using copyrighted or trademarked material without the permission of the holder of the rights.
 \item Material that is sold pursuant to a license may be subject further restrictions on sale.
 \item Given the test scenario assumed for the purposes of this memo, the legality of procuring licensed, copyrighted, or trademarked material and remixing, repurposing, 

\end{itemize}
